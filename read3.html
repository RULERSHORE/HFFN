        <h3 class="text-dark pt-4">3D software innovation</h3>
        
        <p> 3D modeling has come a long way since its humble origins over 40 years ago, meanwhile its capabilities have continually 
            evolved and grown better alongside the technology used to perform it. Thanks to this there are a whole bunch of interesting 
            things going on right now, with plenty more on their way. We are on the precipice of a modeling revolution, where recent technology 
            and those in development seem set to become game changers in the world of 3D modeling.
        </p>
<br>
        <p> For example, the arrival of 3D printing has further enhanced the abilities and potential applications of 3D modeling; while 
            virtual reality, although very new in its current (non-Virtual Boy) form, looks set to change the way we interact with 3D models 
            forever. This skill lends itself to many different industries and professions in varied and surprising ways, and it’s this that 
            makes the future of 3D modeling all the more exciting.
        </p> 
<br>  
            
        <p> Even with the skill’s varied applications, 3D modelers such as myself are bound to have their own area of expertise, a type of 
            thing they most enjoy creating, or even a preferred geometry type. In fact, we’ve already created a post all about 3D Modeling 
            within Autodesk Maya 2016, where we’ve provided info on the geometry types you can work with, as well as some toolset tips and 
            tricks!
        </p>
<br>           
        <p> To truly begin this piece I’m going to run you through some of the interesting and exciting ways 3D models have been put to use 
            within various professions. Let’s start off in the exciting, engaging and at times terrifying world of film and television.
        </p>
<br>
        <h5><b>Construction</b></h5>
        <p>
            3D modeling is also extremely useful for architectural visualization; and I imagine pretty blooming cost 
            effective in the long run, too. When further combined with cloud rendering solutions like GarageFarm.NET’s render farm, 
            the visualizations can come to live in much less time and with much less hassle.
        </p>
<br>
        <h5><b>3D Printing</b></h5>
        <p>
            3D printing is a big topic that could easily fill its own entire post (probably even several). Heck a Google search of the specific 
            term “3D printing” brings up over 33 million results, as opposed to “3D modeling” and “3D modeling”, which total at just over 1 
            million results. This doesn’t mean that 3D modeling is any less of a big deal, if anything the advent of 3D printing has made it 
            more of a big deal, since when it comes down to it, you need someone to 3D model the printed object in the first place. That is, at 
            least, until our robot overlords take over and start designing and printing bigger and better versions of themselves!
        </p>
<br>
        <p>
            The cost of a basic 3D printer is low enough to be affordable to members of the general public; in fact, you can even get one for 
            cheaper than most of the hard hitting virtual reality headsets. For example, the Oculus Rift costs just a smidge under £550, 
            whilst the Playstation VR costs around £350 – meanwhile, you can get your hands on a daVinci Junior 1.0 3D printer for only around 
            £280.
        </p>
<br> 
        <p> 
            There are some blooming cool things that have been 3D printed, from prosthetics improving the lives of children and adults across 
            the world, through to a fully functioning Batman cosplay complete with working gadgets, all the way to a record breaking 17ft 
            (~5m) long Boeing aircraft wing piece. If you’re tempted to buy a 3D printer and print pre-built models, or fancy getting into the 
            3D modeling game and start printing your own stuff at home, it’s worth checking out product reviews first, such as this one for the 
            above-mentioned daVinci.
        </p>
<br>
        <h5><b>Photorealism</b></h5>        
        <p>
           
            True photorealism wouldn’t be possible without smart use of texturing, but you actually need something to apply those textures to, 
            so a detailed 3D model can save the texture artist a lot of extra hassle of ‘faking’ certain details.
<br>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, the more complex the model, the bigger the file size, and this is where the problems can start. If you’re trying to 
            create something photorealistic and are pre-rendering the imagery, feel free to model in as high a resolution as you’d like but be 
            very aware of the medium you want to use that model for, or the amount of render time you have available to you. Also, consider 
            whether you’re going to put money into super fast rendering by using our render farm, thereby allowing you more time to perfect the 
            scene beforehand. Insane levels of complexity can be the case for photorealistic models, especially those sculpted out of digital 
            clay in the likes of Autodesk Mudbox, often with incredible results!
        </p>
<br>
        <p>
            If you’re using the model for animation, vastly over-complicated geometry may crash the software before you even get a chance to 
            do much with it, but if you’re going to be rendering out still images of that model you’re much less limited in what you can 
            achieve.
